Objective: Balance cost and carbon outcomes via multi-objective optimization.

ü§ñ ML MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
  ‚Ä¢ Operational Efficiency: LinearRegression (CV R¬≤ = 1.000)
  ‚Ä¢ Environmental Impact: RandomForest (CV R¬≤ = 0.799)
  ‚Ä¢ Cost Efficiency: RandomForest (CV R¬≤ = 0.979)

üîç KEY FEATURE INSIGHTS:
  ‚Ä¢ Environmental Impact: cost_efficiency_index is most important
  ‚Ä¢ Cost Efficiency: cost_efficiency_index is most important

üå± OPTIMIZATION SCENARIOS (Cost vs Carbon):
  ‚Ä¢ Ai Blockchain Optimization: Ai improvement of 4.6%
  ‚Ä¢ Ai Blockchain Optimization: Blockchain improvement of 20.0%
  ‚Ä¢ Scm Practice Optimization: 30.0% improvement
  ‚Ä¢ Supplier Collaboration Optimization: 25.0% improvement

üí° STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS (Multi-objective):
  1. Scale AI + Blockchain to improve efficiency while enabling traceability and waste reduction
  2. Shift to sustainable SCM practices (Lean/Agile/Sustainable) to cut cost and carbon together
  3. Enhance supplier collaboration to stabilize lead times and reduce expediting emissions
  4. Optimize transport mix and load consolidation to lower both OPEX and CO2e per ton-km
  5. Institutionalize data-driven continuous optimization across cost & sustainability KPIs

üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
  Phase 1 (0-3 months): Multi-objective pilots (cost vs carbon) in 1-2 lanes/products
  Phase 2 (3-6 months): Scale SCM practice optimization and supplier collaboration
  Phase 3 (6-12 months): Expand AI/ERP integration; evaluate blockchain for compliance
  Phase 4 (12+ months): Continuous optimization & carbon accounting integration
